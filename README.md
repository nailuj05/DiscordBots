# DiscordBots
Multiple different Discord Bots written in Python

The TicTacToe Bot is a simple game bot. Using /newGame a player can start a game. With the /play command the players can take turns playing the game

The Moderation Bot has multiple different commands that help with moderating a discord server, such as clear bulks of messages.

The "Patentamt" is a bot I wrote just for fun, it enables users to claim differnt things and can display a list of these. NOTE: If you want to use the bot yourself: The bot is programmed to only react in one channel, if you want to use the bot either remove or replace the channel id in the source code
